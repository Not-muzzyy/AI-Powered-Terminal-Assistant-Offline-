# AI-Powered-Terminal-Assistant-Offline-
AITA is a fully offline AI-powered terminal assistant built entirely in C++. It interacts with users through text commands in the console — answering questions, performing basic tasks, and simulating intelligent conversation — all without needing an internet connection or paid APIs.
AITA uses a local knowledge base (knowledge.txt) to respond intelligently to user queries. When it encounters an unknown question, it falls back on witty or conversational responses, making interactions feel more natural and engaging.

This project demonstrates the power of C++ for creating intelligent, interactive command-line software with real-world usefulness and strong offline functionality.
